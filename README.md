Our team Optimizers is participating in the Smart India Hackathon (SIH), and we have selected this project topic to develop MedSetu, a FHIR-based digital portal for healthcare terminology and patient record management.

MedSetu provides a modular, role-based system for doctors, patients, and admins, featuring terminology mapping, patient record management, and API access for seamless and standardized healthcare data handling.
